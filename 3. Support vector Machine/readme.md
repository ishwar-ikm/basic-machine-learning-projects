### In this section on Support Vector Machines (SVM), we have three distinct projects, each featuring its own SVM model.

# Project 1: Cement Slump Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the compressive strength of cement slumps using Support Vector Regression (SVR). It involves data loading, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, SVM model building, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Key Files
- `cement_slump.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code.
- `data/cement_slump.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis.

# Project 2: Mouse Viral Study

## Overview
This project analyzes a mouse viral study dataset to predict the presence of a virus based on medication variables using Support Vector Classification (SVC). It includes data loading, exploratory data analysis, SVC model building, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Key Files
- `mouse_viral_study.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code.
- `data/mouse_viral_study.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis.

# Project 3: Wine Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on fraud detection in a wine dataset using Support Vector Classification (SVC). It involves data loading, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, SVC model building, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Key Files
- `wine_fraud_detection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code.
- `data/wine_fraud.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis.

# Dependencies
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

# Analysis Steps
1. **Data Loading**: Load the respective dataset from the provided CSV file.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Examine the dataset's structure and visualize key relationships.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the data, split into features and target, scale features, and split into training and testing sets.
4. **SVM Model Building**: Build an SVM model (SVR or SVC) depending on the project requirements.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning with Grid Search**: Fine-tune the model using Grid Search for optimal hyperparameters.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics (MAE, RMSE, confusion matrix, classification report).

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that Python and the required libraries are installed.
- Adjust file paths or configurations in the script as needed.
