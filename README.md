# Machine Learning Learning Projects Repository

This is my Machine Learning learning projects repository! This repository contains a collection of Machine Learning projects I worked on during my learning journey. Each project is a separate folder in this repository, and you can explore them to see what I've learned and accomplished.

## Projects 1
### Predictive Modeling for Ames Housing Prices
- **Description**: The script begins with exploratory data analysis, handling missing values, and outlier removal. It employs visualization techniques using Matplotlib and Seaborn for insights. Categorical variables are transformed, and the final preprocessed dataset is saved as 'AMES_Final_DF.csv.' Subsequently, a linear regression model is constructed to predict housing prices based on various features.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
