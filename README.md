# Machine Learning Learning Projects Repository

This is my Machine Learning learning projects repository! This repository contains a collection of Machine Learning projects I worked on during my learning journey. Each project is a separate folder in this repository, and you can explore them to see what I've learned and accomplished.

## Projects 1: Linear Regression
- **Description**: The script begins with exploratory data analysis, handling missing values, and outlier removal. It employs visualization techniques using Matplotlib and Seaborn for insights. Categorical variables are transformed, and the final preprocessed dataset is saved as 'AMES_Final_DF.csv.' Subsequently, a linear regression model is constructed to predict housing prices based on various features.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

## Project 2: Logistic Regression
- **Description**: This comprehensive project encompasses three distinct analyses: Iris Species Classification, Heart Disease Prediction, and Hearing Test Analysis. Leveraging Python with libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, the analyses include data exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling using logistic regression.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.
