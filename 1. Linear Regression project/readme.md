# Predictive Modeling for Ames Housing Prices

## Overview

This Python project focuses on building a linear regression model to predict housing prices using the Ames Housing dataset. The code includes a comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and visualization techniques to prepare the dataset for modeling.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The script starts with loading the Ames Housing dataset and performs various preprocessing tasks such as handling missing data, outlier removal, and transforming categorical variables. Exploratory data analysis and visualization are conducted to gain insights into the dataset.

2. **model**: After preprocessing, the script constructs a linear regression model using Scikit-learn. The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset to predict housing prices based on selected features. The linear regression model's performance metrics, such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error, are also displayed.

3. **DATA**: Contains the unprocessed data and The final preprocessed dataset is saved as 'AMES_Final_DF.csv.'

## Additional Notes

- Make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
- Adjust the file paths or configurations in the script as needed.
